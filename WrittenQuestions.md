## What additional things would you want to operate this application in a production setting?
    -  I would have structured my code into modules and functions to increase maintainability and readability.
    -  I could have also added trackers on errors to debug it more easily and also some loggers to follow that the application is running normally. (I did it with print during my development of the script)
    -  Add a unit test repo with a unit test to test my functions
